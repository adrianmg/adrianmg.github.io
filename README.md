## Jokes 😄

Because every README needs some humor:

- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛
- How many designers does it take to change a lightbulb? Does it have to be a lightbulb? 💡
- Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 💸
- What's a designer's favorite type of music? Sans-serif! 🎵
- Why do developers hate nature? Too many bugs and no documentation! 🌲

## Fun Facts & Developer Jokes 😄

Since you're here checking out the repo, here are some programming jokes to brighten your day:

**Why do programmers prefer using the dark theme?**  
Because light attracts bugs! 🐛

**A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks:**  
"Can I join you?" 🍻

**Why did the developer go broke?**  
Because he used up all his cache! 💰

**How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?**  
None. That's a hardware problem. 💡

**Why do Java developers wear glasses?**  
Because they can't C#! 👓

**Fun fact:** This website has been built with more coffee ☕ than code. The Jekyll/Hyde reference isn't just about the framework – it's also about my personality before and after my morning espresso!

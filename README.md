## About

Personal website showcasing my work as a Design Director at GitHub Copilot. For the last 18+ years, I've designed digital products between Madrid, London and now, from San Francisco. I also co-founded and later sold my company Erasmusu.

My career started as a Software Developer, but it soon became clear that my true passion was Design. I love combining both skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose, currently focusing on designing and building AI tools for developers at GitHub.

## Built with

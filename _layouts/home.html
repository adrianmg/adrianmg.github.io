      <h2>Product Designer at Microsoft.</h2>
      <p>
        Designing digital products on web/mobile/TV for the last
        <span id="years">10</span>+ years.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started as a Software Developer but it soon became clear that my true passion was Design. I love combining both
        skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand Design as a way of solving problems. Listening, studying and understanding problems while collaborating with
        others in order to create coherent systems that transform complexity into simple solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good Design is simple, honest and, most importantly, invisible. Form follows function and function follows form, and so one
        can't be without the other.

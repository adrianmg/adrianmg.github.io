            <p>
              For the last 17+ years, I've designed digital products between Madrid, London and now, from
              San Francisco. I also co-founded and later sold my company Erasmusu.
            </p>
            <p>
              My career started as a Software Developer, but it soon became clear that my true passion was Design.
              I love combining both skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose.

      <h2>Designing <span class="ampersand">&amp;</span> building tools for developers at Microsoft</h2>
      <p>
        For the last +10 years, I have designed digital products between Madrid, London and now,
        San Francisco. I also co-founded and later sold my startup Erasmusu.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started as a Software Developer but it soon became test clear that my true passion was Design.
        I love combining both skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see Design is as a way of solving problems. Listening and understanding while collaborating with
        others in order to create coherent systems that transform complexity into simple solutions.

      <h2>I design
        <span class="ampersand">&amp;</span> build tools for developers at Microsoft.</h2>
      <p>
        My career started as a software developer but it soon became clear that my true passion was Design. I love combining
        both skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design is as a way of solving problems. Listening, studying and understanding problems while collaborating with others in
        order to create coherent systems that transform complexity into simple solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good Design is simple and honest. Form follows function and function follows form, and so one
        can't be without the other.

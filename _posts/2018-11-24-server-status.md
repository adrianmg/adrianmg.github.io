I'm still not sure where this is going to but I've managed to put some hours to code the first part of it. I've started with a ***nodejs*** client that pulls information from a list of endpoints and write all that data into a Firebase real-time database.

![UI components race calculator]({{ "/assets/images/posts/2018/server-status-01.gif" | relative_url }})

Stay tunned, I think it's going to be useful. I'm going to invest the next few days working on a React client that would read all this information and  give it some structure to make this more useful.

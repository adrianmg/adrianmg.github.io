Some news, [IvÃ¡n](http://ivanguardado.com) has paired up with me helping to improve the business logic, and making the code a bit more robust for future steps. I'm trying to put together a template to generate the first version of the front-end. Basically we will be able to serve all the data we're collecting.

I've refactored and added long polling to the **nodejs** application so now I can control how often the date is going to be retrieved. I also set up a simple docker container that allows me to deploy the app to **now/zeit** continuously.

Here's a preview of the app running while updating the real-time database from **firebase**:

I'm going to leave this up and running for a few days as I keep making progress on the client side. Hopefully, it doesn't crash ðŸ˜….

I'm still not sure where this is going to, but I've managed to put some hours to code the first part of it. I've started with a **nodejs** client that pulls information from a list of endpoints and write all that data into a Firebase real-time database.

Stay tuned, I think it's going to be useful. I'm going to invest the next few days working on a React client that would read all this information and give it some structure to make this more useful.

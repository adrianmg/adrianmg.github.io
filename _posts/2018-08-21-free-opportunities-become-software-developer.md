summary: "As some of you may know I've been supporting and helping [Lucia](https://luciagm.net) to pivot from Economics, Operations and Customer Support to make a career change and become a Front-End Developer.


One of the many good parts is discovering a **new world full of opportunities** that range from non-profit organizations up to generous scholarships to access different courses that would help you take the first steps into the Software Development world.


I'm **sharing the programs to learn to code** that I've found the most fascinating for different reasons. Hopefully, it would inspire others to take action across the world. I hope this encourages other people to make a change in their career."

### [**The Odin Project**](https://theodinproject.com): the all-around program
{:.anchor }
When we talk about [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com), we're probably talking about one of the most inspiring and complete online curriculums. It's backed up by a fantastic *open source community*, and the quality of the content is unbelievable good.

You'd find content that covers the basics of *Web Development*, *Backend* with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Databases, *Front-End* with HTML, CSS and a pretty long list of JavaScript lessons and, finally, 14 lessons on *getting hired*.

### [**freeCodeCamp**](https://freecodecamp.org): web development and certifications
{:.anchor }
If you are interested in getting *official free certifications* and learning specifically *Web Development*, mostly on the *Front-End* side, then [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) is a great course for you. You'd also gain real *experience* by working for non-profit organizations.


### [**Khan Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming): accesible first steps
{:.anchor }
If you’re convinced of learning how to code but still didn’t decide what kind of programming you’d like to learn, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) offers a video series where you’d be able to determine the basics to step into the programming world. Unlike other programs more focused on web development, this course focuses initially a little bit more in the logic using JavaScript as a first excuse.

After the initial lessons, you'd get your hands dirty, and you'd start creating your first web pages using HTML and CSS, that eventually would grow in complexity into more interactive and sophisticated apps (including databases). There are also some interesting lessons for using JavaScript to develop small video games.

### [**interviewing.io**](https://interviewing.io): practice anonymous technical interviews

Learning to program is one of the many different steps a person would need to go through. That’s why I find [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) a pretty helpful service. It lets you do anonymous technical interviews with volunteers from big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and more.

The past year has been an amazing one, but before getting into the details, Iâ€™d love to share some thoughts on 2017 as I have been struggling to talk about it for quite a while.

### Coming from a tough 2017

On February 2017, we moved to San Francisco as it seemed to be a great professional opportunity for both me and Lucia. It turned to be one of the most challenging years:

- [Lucia](http://luciagm.net) gave up her job in London and couldnâ€™t find anything good
- Our dog [Coco](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGtZevCLPL4/) passed away (we miss him so much)
- Timezones and distance with family and friends
- I wasn't as happy as before at my job

The transition between Madrid and London was so smooth that I think we overlooked how difficult it would be to move to a different continent, country, and city.

We almost gave up, every week we would sit down and discuss moving back. We were so contaminated that we couldnâ€™t enjoy anything, even the good news. I still feel guilty for asking Lucia to move with me giving up her job.

When things couldnâ€™t get worse, we did a hard reset. We forced ourselves to be more **positive**, to **give it a try**, and things started (slowly) to feel better. I know it sounds like bullshit, but sometimes looking at the same problems with **different eyes** is a good first step towards a better situation.

### It's been an amazing 2018!

The past 2018 has been arguably one of the best years of my life. It was the first time Iâ€™ve managed not just to accomplish my own goals, but also helped others to achieve theirs. After all, we have gone through, and I feel we deserved it.

- **Helped** Lucia with a career change [into Front-End Development](https://blog.udacity.com/2018/12/lucia-gonzalez-nanodegree-powered-career-change.html).
- **Changed jobs** and joined Microsoft [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)
- **Run** my [first marathon](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl00FpfltWM/) and a total of 670 Km
- **Traveled** more: Yosemite, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Vegas, Mexico, Seattle, Raleighâ€¦
- **Shot** a lot of [photos](https://500px.com/adrianmg)
- **Build** and launched [my website](http://adrianmato.com)
- **Got promoted** at Microsoft (finally?)
- **Sold** [my first company, Erasmusu](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/spotahome-acquires-erasmusu/) (excellent job, Javi, Emilio, and Ivan!)
- **Modeled** more 3D stuff
- Failed at reading more books

The best thing happened at the end of the year, after an entire year studying on her own on a full-time basis, **Lucia has landed her first job** as a [Front-End Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucia-gonzalez-moscoso/). There are no words to describe how happy and accomplished we both felt after this entire year of tireless effort. **Being able to share and enjoy some common goals with other people has been the most significant learning from this year**. Iâ€™d love to do more of that during 2019.

Because one picture is worth a thousand wordsâ€¦ here are a few summarizing my year ðŸ™‚.

Thanks to everyone that helped to make a fantastic year. Iâ€™m planning to share my goals for 2019 in an upcoming post. Until then, Happy New Year to everyone! ðŸ™‚

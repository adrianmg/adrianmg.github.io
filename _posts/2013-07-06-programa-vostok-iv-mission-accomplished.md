All good things must come to an end and yesterday (after six months) was the last class of [Programa Vostok IV](http://programavostok.com).

It was such a great pleasure to be part of this fantastic group of people: [Alberto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertodiazhernandez/), [Carlos](https://matall.in), [Danny](https://twitter.com/dsaltaren), [Inma](http://chavalina.net), [Mar√≠a](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-barcel%C3%B3-isern-13092159/), [Marta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martagarciapascual/) and [Pau](http://www.pau.cc). We‚Äôve shared so much time together: learning, thinking, talking, discussing, and understanding Design.

I just want to say **‚Äúthank you‚Äù** to all of you. We started as a group of professionals trying to grow as designers, but now, we‚Äôre also a group of friends. I wish and hope you find whatever makes you happy. I wish we could find time to keep sharing thoughts, work, experiences, and discussions about Design once a month.

Thank you [Javier Ca√±ada](https://www.terremoto.net), for sharing your knowledge and experiences with us. I appreciate your effort to **articulate** and **explain** in such an inspiring and easy manner all the concepts. Thanks for changing the way I see Design and also my role as a designer.

As some of you may know, I‚Äôm not a big fan of *academic learning*, big classes, official certifications‚Ä¶ that kind of stuff. But this time, that was really different. Having a small group of people from different areas, sharing an interest in Design was a powerful combination.

That leads me to say that size of the class, a **diverse group**, a **common goal** and **trust** are definitively a must if you want to really learn and grow in any kind of subject.


I‚Äôm glad to have met you all, I‚Äôm proud of being part of Programa Vostok IV,

Thank you! üíõ

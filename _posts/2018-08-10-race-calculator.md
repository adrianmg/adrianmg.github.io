summary: "
I'm preparing along with [Lucia](http://luciagm.net) a pet project that would let people estimate the race pace and total time when running races. It's the perfect excuse to do two things:

- She’d keep improving her front-end skills

- Create a small UI kit to facilitate future pet projects


I've been pondering about the idea of having a daily worklog, let's give it a try! If you got comments or suggestions please do [share them](http://twitter.com/adrianmg).

When thinking about the visual execution of new projects I always start with the basic unit of information which is the text and its type ramp. I’m also going back to native fonts since they run fast as hell though I may take the license to use Montserrat for big bold titles when representing the time and other cool data about your running stats.

I’d keep you posted!

I’m trying to map the basic elements that would be needed in order to have the race calculator. I don’t feel 100% convinced of what should be the right approach: asking the user what they need to know (pace VS total time) or just give all the option and let them figure out. At this point, I’m towards defaulting to set a pace that would generate the total time and they would be able to switch from a pivot to the other option.

I’m sharing some rough sketches of the process from my notebook:

**Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not.**

As we welcome our [newest Design Engineer](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fwjnjhsdebcvhstqd2ab2z7c/post/3lgy5ckbznc22) to the [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) Design team, I've noticed a trend—the last four hires have all been from Europe. Many of GitHub's most talented designers are overseas, complementing a widely distributed North American workforce across timezones.

In contrast, **many CEOs continue pushing for office returns, insisting that AI innovation can only thrive in San Francisco**. This coordinated narrative makes me question the real motivation behind it. Is it truly about productivity, or is it more about keeping office landlords, VCs, and gatekeepers happy?

Funny enough, **DeepSeek** caught everyone off guard [this week](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120), proving once again that innovation and creativity aren't exclusive to a limited group of people nor region—and that great things can happen anywhere in the world.

Many startups, including my current employer [GitHub](https://github.com), thrived on remote work. Yet, many remote-friendly companies are pulling back—not because remote work failed, but because they have failed to [scale](https://adrianmato.com/blog/industry/opinion/bigger-isnt-better-companies-scale-dilemma/) effectively. When a startup grows from 100 to thousands, bureaucracy creeps in, and efficiency crumbles. The trust that fueled innovation erodes, and leadership fears losing oversight. In that scenario, remote workers seem less convenient than chair-warmers at the office.

However, most modern work is already remote. Teams sit in offices wearing noise-canceling headphones, joining video calls with peers in the same building. **If it was this simple, companies wouldn't struggle to ship while their offices are full**.

Don't get me wrong, I love in-person collaboration. I love grabbing a piece of paper and a pencil, a marker and a whiteboard, and have deep discussions. My early days at GitHub were filled with camaraderie and valuable spontaneous conversations at the office. Most of this is replicable with async video walkthroughs, iPad sketch sharing, and other remote collaboration tools. In fact, most of us are building those tools to foster collaboration.

Companies that are able to see past trends, and find a hybrid model to allow them to identify, attract, and retain talent will outcompete those stuck in the 20th-century. Back in the day job-hopping wasn't as common, but forcing relocation in a hyper-connected world is backward. People have family, friends, and a community that made them who they are today.

Remote work isn't for everyone. It demands proactivity, clear communication, and strong independence— qualities that matter anywhere remotely or at the office.

Many of the world's brightest minds have come to the U.S., made significant contributions, grew, and then left—driven away by visa barriers, personal priorities, or simply a different lifestyle. Meanwhile, hidden talent in small towns worldwide keeps refining their craft, waiting for a chance. I write this from a privileged perspective—as a Spaniard who moved to the U.S., built a career in tech, and helped shape one of the most successful AI-driven products. I know firsthand how hard it is to break in and how many obstacles stand in the way. There's nothing better than finding someone in the middle of nowhere doing their best work.

Focus on output, not attendance. The best teams aren’t built by location. They’re built by **finding the best minds, wherever they are**.

**Talent wins. Attract it. Build the best team possible. Win.**

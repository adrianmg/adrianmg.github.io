summary: "I've been reflecting on the scale of companies lately after sixteen years of working in the industry. I've worked for small, medium, and big companies. I've also worked for startups, and I've been a founder myself. I've seen the good and the bad of each one of them. Here are some hot takes."

We need more companies doing fewer things, fewer features, and requiring fewer employees. Building high-quality software is fun when you have focus and a tight team.

The current scale of most teams and the absurd financial goals make a large portion of this industry unbearable.

Redistributing the workforce among more companies will generate more competition and ownership. Ultimately, end-users will benefit from better products and solutions as well.

he scale pushes us to generate intermediate layers of tech, processes, middle management, and other crap, distracting us from creating better products.

Massive layoffs and flattening organizations won't solve this unless companies reduce commitments and focus on providing value.

Most of these problems have been auto-infringed. It's puzzling to see hyper-growth startups sprinting into the scale issue as soon as they raise some money. Rather than benefiting from focus and a competitive advantage, they decide to jump right into the fire with the rest of companies.

I got bad news: introducing more processes and trying to generate order in a bloated, stressful system that's overly ambitious won't work; it will burn out most of your team.

We can, and should do better than this.

After eight years working together, [mamuso](http://mamuso.net) and I thought it was time to build something together out of work, so here we are. We have a specific goal: to improve the sharing of process, work in progress, and feedback for creators. We are trying to limit the technical complexity by relying on a [JavaScript boilerplate](https://github.com/nice-boys/product-boilerplate) that [Max](https://mobile.twitter.com/mxstbr/) and [Brian](https://mobile.twitter.com/brian_lovin) have put together.

We got login sessions working via Google Auth, but I'm currently working on a [Passport Twitter Strategy](http://passportjs.org).
